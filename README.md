# Loop-Invariant-Synthesizer
This is the final project of the Software Synthesis and Automated Reasoning course

# Running Tests Benchmarks
The script for running the tests benchmarks can be invoked by running the main file and adding --tests to the script.

# Timeout Option
It is possible to provide a timeout for each input python program run, by adding "--time-out" (or '-t' for short).
This option can be added regardless of run mode, meaning it can be added whether you are running the test benchmarks or using the tool with your personal inputs for your own run.

# The Input Format
To successfully run the tool on a python code, you need to provide the python code you wish to synthesis, the grammar (which must be a sub Grammar of the grammar found in [syntax.py][^1](https://github.com/AbuJabal-Hussein/Loop-Invariant-Synthesizer/blob/5ceb5e550787e27639146f98f755b365466f3c23/syntax.py)
